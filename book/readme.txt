Feature 4 README

Please DO NOT edit anything in this folder!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the feature 4: Book Details folder. The folder has been renamed to "book" so that the website accesses this folder
when you go the bookdetails page (http://localhost:3300/book/bookdetails.php?book=1)



bookdetails.php opens a book details page. You MUST be connected to your Apache localhost:3300 server from XAMPP in
order for this to work.

./index.php file in the main repo folder works as a homepage. Click Feature 4 - Details to test my feature.

f4scripts folder just has some scripts for the minimized window content and the accordion drop down for the reviews.

css folder holds my css file. This is kinda ugly looking and will have to be updated soon.

img folder currently holds the background image for the bookdetails page.

depreciated-stuff folder has old files from when I tried running the server on .js backend. Don't use these, they'll be deleted soon!

Go check out the bookdetails.php for a small tutorial and example code of php and SQL queries in action.

Feel free to copy any code and ask me any questions about how I set up something here.
