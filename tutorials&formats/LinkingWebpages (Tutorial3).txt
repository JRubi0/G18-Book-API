To link to another page in html/php, you can use this example: 
<a href='book/bookdetails.php?book=1'> Go to Book 1 </a>

This creates a link to http://localhost:3300/book/bookdetails.php?book=1

Breaking that down:
    book, links to the book folder
    bookdetails.php, the webpage file
    ?book=1, parameter that gets sent to PHP code

This parameter can be replaced with a php variable like $book_id.

(You can use $GET_ to use these parameters like variables in your php code, for example: $book_id = $_GET['book']
 This would return a value of 1 since ?book = 1 in the URL)


Another link example using a php variable as a parameter: <a href='search/searchresults.php?author_id=$author_id'>

This would open a link to the search function, search results page, preforming a search by author for whatever author_id is.
